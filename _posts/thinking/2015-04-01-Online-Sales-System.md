Web-based Offline Sales System - Project of Database Design Course
===============

1. Short overview
====
The sales system is designed for retail chain stores to digitalize checking out process and make it easier to manage warehouse as well as store information. This sales system is based on three aspects. First, on the aspect of inner company, it is to store and manage information of products, employees, stores and regions. Second, it is to manage the relationship with customers, which can be classified into business and home categories. The last one is for the transactions and records storage and management.<br/>
The users of the system include customers and employees of the company. The administrator of this system is also an employee, who has a higher privilege than other employees to handle issues of employee, store and region.<br/>
This system also has a function of data aggregation. It allows administrator to clearly view sales data, providing an easy access for data analysis.<br/>


2. Assumptions
====
1) This sales system is designed for a retail chain store, such as Target.<br/>
2) Considering the system is for the process of checking out, purchasing is based on
scanning membership cards and products bar codes in a physical store.<br/>
3) Customers who do not log in have the lowest privilege. That is they can only browse
products information.<br/>
4) Customers who have logged in the system have privileges of browsing products
information, updating profile and reviewing their order history.<br/>
5) Employees can browse products information, add customers, update profile, and add,
update and delete products, product categories and transactions.<br/>
6) The administrator can add, update and delete records of employee, store and region.<br/>
7) All the customers can be classified into either business customer or home customer.

3. Technology
====
1) Back-end: JSP, Servlet<br/>
2) Front-end: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap Framework<br/>
3) Database: MySQL

4. Front-end Design
====
The front-end includes five main parts: login page, guest page, customer page, employee page and administrator page. Login page achieves the function of users login. Employee, customer and administrator can choose their identity type on login page. Guests can access to the system for simple product research without login. This function is achieved on the guest page. Customer page is designed for customer functions including searching products, updating profile and reviewing order history. Employee page allows employees to edit profile, product, category, customer and other functions. Administrator page allows administrator to get data aggregation results and manage employees. Customer page, employee page and administrator page all have a navigation bar for main functions. <br/>

6. Limitations and improvements
====
1) Some data in string type with special characters may not be checked.<br/>
2) Password needs higher privacy. In the current system, password can be found in the URL
when a user logs in the system.<br/>
3) Temporarily, we do not achieve the function of online shopping. It can be implemented in
further improvement.<br/>
4) We have do not achieve the function of editing stores and regions.<br/>
5) Employee and salary changing need to be taken into consideration.<br/>
6) Atomic operation of transaction is not realized.<br/>
